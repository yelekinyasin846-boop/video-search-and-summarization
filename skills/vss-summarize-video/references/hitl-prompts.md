# Video Summarization — HITL Prompt Walkthroughs

### HITL: confirm the VLM prompt first (REQUIRED — do not skip)

**Before any call to the VLM, you MUST show the default prompt to the
user verbatim and wait for their response.** Do not proceed on silence
and do not assume defaults.

You MAY reuse a confirmed prompt from earlier in the same chat **only
if** the user is asking to re-summarize the **same video** (same
`streamId` / clip URL) — in that case, remind the user what prompt
you're about to reuse and offer them the chance to change it before
calling. For any **different video**, re-run the HITL from scratch.

Post the message as follows (literal template — fill the `{video_name}`
placeholder):

> I'm about to summarize **{video_name}** with this VLM prompt. Reply
> `Submit` to use it as-is, paste replacement text, `/generate <desc>`
> to rewrite it from a description, `/refine <instr>` to tweak it, or
> `/cancel` to stop.
>
> ```
> <default VLM prompt below>
> ```

**Default VLM prompt** (copy verbatim from the base profile):

```
Describe in detail what is happening in this video,
including all visible people, vehicles, equipments, objects,
actions, and environmental conditions.
OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
[timestamp-timestamp] Description of what is happening.
EXAMPLE:
[0.0s-4.0s] <description of the first event>
[4.0s-12.0s] <description of the second event>
```

**User response handling:**

| User input | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Submit` (or empty) | Approve the current prompt and call the VLM |
| Any other free text | Treat as a full replacement prompt; echo it back and ask for `Submit` before calling |
| `/generate <description>` | You (the assistant) write a new prompt from the description, show it back, and wait for `Submit` |
| `/refine <instructions>` | You (the assistant) refine the current prompt per the instructions, show it back, and wait for `Submit` |
| `/cancel` | Cancel summarization |

Rules:

- You MAY call the VLM **only** after receiving `Submit` (or an empty
  confirmation) on a prompt that is currently visible in the chat.
- `/generate` and `/refine` are not terminal — they produce a new prompt
  that itself needs `Submit`.
- When handling `/generate` and `/refine`, preserve the
  `[Xs-Ys] <description>` output-format requirement from the default
  prompt.
- If the user just says "go" / "ok" / "yes" without having seen the
  prompt, show the prompt first, then wait for `Submit`.


### HITL: collect scenario and events first (REQUIRED — do not skip)

**Before any call to `POST /v1/summarize`, you MUST ask the user for
`scenario`, `events`, and `objects_of_interest`, and wait for their
response.** Do not call the video summarization service with defaults silently — if the user wants
defaults, they must say so explicitly (e.g., "use the generic
defaults").

You MAY reuse previously confirmed `scenario` / `events` /
`objects_of_interest` from earlier in the same chat **only if** the user
is asking to re-summarize the **same video** (same `streamId` / clip
URL) — in that case, remind the user which parameters you're about to
reuse and let them change them before calling. For any **different
video**, re-run the HITL from scratch.

Post the message as follows (literal template — fill the `{video_name}`
and `{duration}` placeholders):

> I'm about to send **{video_name}** ({duration}s) to the video summarization service. I need three
> parameters first:
>
> 1. **`scenario`** — one-line context, e.g. `"warehouse monitoring"`,
>    `"traffic monitoring"`
> 2. **`events`** — a comma-separated list of events to surface, e.g.
>    `accident, pedestrian crossing`, `boxes falling, forklift stuck, accident`
> 3. **`objects_of_interest`** *(optional)* — things to track, e.g.
>    `cars, trucks, pedestrians` or `forklifts, pallets, workers`.
>    Leave blank if you don't want to specify any.
>
> Or reply `defaults` to use `scenario="activity monitoring"`,
> `events=["notable activity"]`, no objects. Reply `/cancel` to stop.

Only after the user replies with values (or `defaults`) may you build
and send the video summarization request.

**Required parameters:**

| Param | Type | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `scenario` | string (required) | `"activity monitoring"`, `"traffic monitoring"`, `"warehouse monitoring"` |
| `events` | list[string] (required) | `["notable activity"]`, `["accident", "pedestrian crossing"]` |
| `objects_of_interest` | list[string] (optional) | `["cars", "trucks", "pedestrians"]` |

If the user explicitly replies `defaults` to the HITL prompt above, use
`scenario="activity monitoring"` and `events=["notable activity"]`, and
mention in your response that you used generic defaults (offer to redo
with more specific parameters). **Do not apply defaults without that
explicit opt-in** — the HITL message is the gate.

**Defaults opt-in via the original query (autonomous mode).** When HITL
is bypassed (e.g. the caller said "run autonomously without prompting
for confirmation") and the original query contains the word `default`
or `defaults` for scenario/events, treat that as the same opt-in as a
HITL `defaults` reply: use `scenario="activity monitoring"` and
`events=["notable activity"]` **verbatim** - do not infer the scenario
from the video filename, sensor name, or any other context. In the
final reply, note that you used the generic defaults and offer to redo
with more specific parameters. The same rule applies if the original
query gives no scenario/events at all and HITL is bypassed - use the
canonical defaults rather than guessing.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${LVS_BACKEND_URL:-http://localhost:38111}/v1/summarize" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "<clip_url_from_vss_manage_video_io_storage>",
    "model": "'"${VLM_NAME:-nim_nvidia_cosmos-reason2-8b_hf-1208}"'",
    "scenario": "<scenario>",
    "events": ["<event1>", "<event2>"],
    "chunk_duration": 10,
    "num_frames_per_second_or_fixed_frames_chunk": 20,
    "use_fps_for_chunking": false,
    "seed": 1
  }' | jq .
```

Omit `objects_of_interest` if the user did not provide any. Include it as a
JSON array otherwise. `num_frames_per_chunk` still exists in the OpenAPI schema
for compatibility, but it is deprecated in 3.2.0; prefer
`num_frames_per_second_or_fixed_frames_chunk` with `use_fps_for_chunking`.

**Response shape:** OpenAI-style envelope. `choices[0].message.content` is a
**JSON string** — parse it to get the actual summary and event list.

```bash
jq -r '.choices[0].message.content' response.json | jq '{video_summary, events}'
```
