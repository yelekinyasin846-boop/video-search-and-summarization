## Licensing

This project uses a dual-license model:

- **Apache-2.0** — applies to all code in the repository except the `services/ui/` directory.
- **MIT** — applies to the original code under the `services/ui/` directory, which is derived from [NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit UI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-UI/).

**All contributions to this repository, regardless of which directory they target, are accepted under the Apache-2.0 license.** Even if you are contributing changes to the `services/ui/` directory, your contribution will be licensed under Apache-2.0. The original `services/ui/` code retains its MIT license, but any additions or modifications contributed through this repository are Apache-2.0.

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for the full license texts.

### Signing Your Work — Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

We require that all contributors "sign off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or that you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license. Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```

This will append the following to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```

If you have already made commits without a sign-off, you can amend the most recent one:

```bash
git commit --amend -s --no-edit
```

By adding a `Signed-off-by` line you are certifying that the contribution complies with the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) reproduced below.

## Code contributions

### Your first issue

1. Read the project's [README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/blob/main/README.md)
    to learn how to set up the development environment.
2. Find an issue to work on. The best way is to look for the [good first issue](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
    or [help wanted](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) labels.
3. Comment on the issue saying you are going to work on it.
4. Code! Make sure to update unit tests!
5. When done, [create your pull request](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/video-search-and-summarization/compare).
6. Verify that CI passes all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/), or fix if needed.
7. Wait for other developers to review your code and update code as needed.
8. Once reviewed and approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request.

Remember, if you are unsure about anything, don't hesitate to comment on issues and ask for clarifications!

### Pull request guidelines

- Provide a clear description of the changes in your PR.
- Reference any issues closed by the PR with "closes #1234".
- Ensure new or existing tests cover your changes.
- Keep the documentation up to date with your changes.

### Local development and testing

Before opening a PR, please enable the pre-commit hooks and, ideally, run the GitHub Actions CI locally. Both workflows mirror the checks that run on CI, so passing them locally means the PR will pass remote checks.

#### 1. Enable pre-commit hooks

The repository ships with a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` at the root that runs the same lint and type-check steps as CI:

- `ruff check` — mirrors the CI `Lint (Python)` job
- `ruff format --check` — mirrors the CI `Lint (Python)` job
- `mypy src/vss_agents/` — mirrors the CI `Type Check (mypy)` job
- TruffleHog secret scan

Install the hooks once after cloning the repo:

```bash
cd services/agent
uv venv --python 3.13
uv sync --group dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

After that, the hooks run automatically on every `git commit`. To run them manually against all files:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you need to bypass a hook for a specific commit (rare, and not recommended), use `SKIP=<hook-id> git commit …` or `git commit --no-verify`.

#### 2. Run the CI workflow locally with `act`

The full GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) can be executed locally using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act), which runs the workflow in Docker containers that match GitHub's runners.

Install `act` (see its [README](https://github.com/nektos/act#installation) for other platforms):

```bash
# Linux / macOS (Homebrew)
brew install act

# Linux (curl)
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

You'll also need Docker running locally.

From the repository root, run the push workflow:

```bash
act push --workflows .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

This executes every job in parallel (lint, typecheck, test, security scan, UI lint/typecheck, UI build). The first run downloads the `catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest` image (~1 GB); subsequent runs reuse the cached image.

Notes:

- `act` does not have GitHub's `ACTIONS_RUNTIME_TOKEN`, so the `actions/upload-artifact` step in the `Test (pytest)` job will fail at the end. This is expected and does not affect the test result — the tests themselves will have already passed.
- To run a single job, pass `-j <job-id>`, e.g. `act push -j lint`.
- If you hit GitHub API rate limits on `actions/setup-node`, pass a token: `act push --secret GITHUB_TOKEN=$(gh auth token)`.

### Branch naming

Branches used to create PRs should have a name of the form `<type>/<name>` which conforms to the following conventions:

- Type:
    - `feat` - For new features
    - `fix` - For bug fixes
    - `docs` - For documentation changes
    - `refactor` - For code refactoring
    - `test` - For adding or updating tests
- Name:
    - A name to convey what is being worked on
    - Please use dashes between words as opposed to spaces.
